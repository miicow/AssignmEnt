This is a little assignment that should give us a better understanding of your capabilities with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  Attached is a sample layout along with a wireframe of Origin about page. Your assignment is to transform this mock-up into a functioning web page. Below is the technical requirements for this assignment:

1)	The background along with game icons are part of a background media carousel. Below is the requirement for timing of content rotation:
a. Images: images along with the game icon rotate should every 10 seconds
b. Videos: videos should play to the end before rotating (along with game icon)

The carousel is expected to be able to handle any of these content:
a.	Multiple videos (with variable lengths)
b.	Single video
c.	Multiple images
d.	Single image
e.	Combination of videos and images

2)	Videos are all hosted on YouTube.
3)	Use images/videos provided in the html attached.
4)	The top navigation should be dynamically populated; navigation anchor data should come from anchors <about-navigation-anchor> embedded in each <about-section>.Keep in mind that the order in which each <about-navigation-anchor> gets initialized is not guaranteed. The ordering of each anchor in top navigation should be preserved. NOTE: The top navigation can be seen near the center of the top section in the wireframe, which reads:
a.	“Great PC Games                            Download Now”
5)	The page must be fully functional in latest versions of Edge, Firefox and Chrome
6)  Bonus 1: Pause carousel videos when out of the viewport, the video should resume when video is back in viewport
7)	Bonus 2: Make the page responsive



This is what should happen when the page loads:

All three sections will load as per mock up and 3 media carousels will start rotating / looping individually (unless they have only 1 image). At the same time, as soon as the page loads, the navigation will be populated. When the user clicks any link in the navigation, the page scrolls to that section of the page. To go back to the top, the user has to scroll back up.


You can write the assignment with any javascript libraries you like ( Angular/React/Polymer/jQuery/etc ) or even vanilla javascript. The assignment should not take more than 4 hours. Have fun, and please submit a .zip file with any source files that we need to run your assignment.
